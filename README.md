[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TylerFlar/Cache-Simulator/blob/main/Cache-Simulator.ipynb)

A simulation tool inspired by instruction from the University of California, San Diego's CSE 142 course. 

## Overview

The Cache Simulator allows users to emulate how cache memory interacts with the main memory and how various cache configurations and policies affect performance. This is crucial for performance tuning and understanding hardware-software interactions.

## Features
* Simulate cache hits and misses.
* Understand different types of cache misses: Compulsory, Capacity, and Conflict.
* Configurable cache parameters: Block size, Cache size, and Associativity.
* Timestamp-based Least Recently Used (LRU) cache replacement policy.
* Export results to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Usage
Visit the Cache Simulator on Google Colab: [Cache Simulator Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TylerFlar/Cache-Simulator/blob/main/Cache-Simulator.ipynb)

Simply run the cells in the notebook to initialize the simulator, set your desired configuration, and run simulations. You can then analyze the results in the generated CSV or directly within the notebook.
